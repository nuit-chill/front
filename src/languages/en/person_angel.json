        "bad": "No",
        "good": "Yes, it all depends on where the food comes from.",
        "response": "Large areas of forest have been destroyed by agriculture. It is therefore imperative to protect them, as trees and plants absorb carbon from the atmosphere. In addition, livestock farming produces large quantities of greenhouse gases (80% of emissions from the agricultural sector in France) during its life cycle. Reducing the amount of meat you eat and favouring products from organic farming will help to reduce these gases.",

        "response": "The main risks will be extreme climatic events, i.e. periods of drought, flooding, storms, cyclones, as well as hot and cold spells. In addition, there are also trends such as rising sea levels and temperatures.",
        "response_bad": "Even if 2°C doesn't sound like much, it can have a big impact on the environment.",
